        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born on February 19, 1630, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha
        clan. Eventually, Shivaji Maharaj carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate
        of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of
        his realm at Raigad Fort.<br>Over the course of his life, Shivaji Maharaj engaged in both alliances and
        hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial
        powers. His military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming
        a Maratha navy. Shivaji Maharaj established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured
        administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the
        usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.

"सागराचे पाणी कधी आटणार नाही,
स्वराज्याची आठवण कधी मिटणार नाही,
हा जन्म काय, हजार जन्म झाले,
तरी नाद “शिवरायांचा” सुटणार नाही.
जय भवानी जय शिवाजी"</pre>
